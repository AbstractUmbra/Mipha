# Mipha

Mipha is a private and personal use Discord bot.
Mipha started as a fork of [R. Danny](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny) which I have now modified greatly.

This is also my testing bot for the latest release of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Setup

Currently I do not support running an instance of my bot, sorry.
Setup details will not be given, if you can figure it out, go nuts.
